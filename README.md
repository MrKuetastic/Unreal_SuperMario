# **Super Mario World 3D - An Infinite Clouds Project** 🎮✨  

Welcome to **Super Mario World 3D**, our collaborative game development adventure!  
We’re a group of recent Computer Science graduates from Wayne State University bringing the classic **Super Mario World (SNES)** into a modern **3D experience** — inspired by the original game’s charm and powered by today’s tools.  

This project is both a **fun tribute** and a **hands-on learning journey** into:
- **Unreal Engine 5** for world-class real-time rendering and gameplay mechanics  
- **MagicaVoxel** for charming voxel-based environment and prop creation  
- **Blender** for asset refinement and animations  
- **GitHub** for real-world, team-based version control and collaboration  

---

## 🚀 **Our Goals**
- Recreate iconic levels and gameplay mechanics from Super Mario World  
- Explore professional **game development pipelines** from modeling to deployment  
- Strengthen our skills in **C++**, **Blueprints**, 3D asset creation, and team workflow  
- Deliver a playable, polished demo as a **portfolio showcase**

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**
- **Unreal Engine 5** – Core game engine (C++ & Blueprints)  
- **MagicaVoxel** – Creating voxel-style blocks, props, and scenery  
- **Blender** – Mesh cleanup, animation, and export pipeline  
- **Git LFS + GitHub** – Asset-friendly version control  
- **Substance Painter / GIMP** – Optional texture work

## 👥 **The Team**
- **Team Lead / Gameplay Programmer:** Oversees core mechanics, physics, and merges  
- **Level Designer / Environment Artist:** Builds immersive voxel-style worlds  
- **3D Asset Artist / Animator:** Crafts and animates characters, enemies, and props  
- **Systems Programmer / UI & Audio:** Handles UI/HUD systems, audio integration, optimization  

---

## 📅 **Milestone Plan**
- **Phase 1:** Core movement, camera, and collision systems  
- **Phase 2:** First level blockout & asset imports  
- **Phase 3:** Power-ups, enemies, scoring system  
- **Phase 4:** Audio, polish, performance optimization  
- **Phase 5:** Final demo build
